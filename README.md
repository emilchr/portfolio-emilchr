# Emilchr's Portfolio Project

## HTML
Basic structure, with all the content visible in the source code.

## CSS
Plain design with responsiveness for mobile devices and larger displays.

## Javascript
Three features with four functions.

## Git
Every new feature and every fix is logged in the version control system.

## Overall
The project was finished in about 14 hours.
At first I struggled a bit to get the javascript to access the DOM elements correctly, but when I cracked the code everything flowed nicely.

I hope you will enjoy my project.
